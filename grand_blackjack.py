command line blackjack game
uses 1 deck with 4 suits which reshuffle when ~5 cards are left
you start with two cards and add them up, if you have 21, then you have a blackjack
dealer is the computer
player plays first, then dealer goes
the better score not exceeding 21 wins
if the dealer and player are equal, then the hand is a tie
any score over 21 is a bust
player starts off with 100 chips to bet
can bet any amount they want at start, but must bet at least 1
if player looses: the bet is taken by the dealer
if player wins: the player wins the amount of the orginal bet
if player wins by with a natural blackjack: the player wins 1.5x the orginal bet
if game ends with tie: player doesn't loose or win any chips
